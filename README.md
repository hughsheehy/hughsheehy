- 👋 Hi, I’m @hughsheehy
- 👀 I’m interested in business, technology, sailing (including windsurfing and kitesurfing), history and general geekery. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter (again), Go (again), coding javascript in Wix, how to make PWAs with no work, and how to use Web-GL for large scale data viz. Plus, I must go back and play with Vaex on some really big datasets again and built it into some ML workflows. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects. I'm not REALLY a coder, more a tech/business guy. An MBA and all. But then again, I do code. Even if it all ends up looking like Fortran. 
- 📫 Look me up on www.hughsheehy.com
