- 👋 Hi, I’m @hughsheehy
- 👀 I’m interested in business, technology, sailing (including windsurfing and kitesurfing), history and general geekery. 
- 💞️ CEO of Go Eve. Our DockChain solution is revolutionizing EV charging around the world. 
- 📫 Look us up on https://goeve.com
- I do bits of code, on and off. Python one day. JS the next. But pretty much all of it is in private repos so you won't see much here.
